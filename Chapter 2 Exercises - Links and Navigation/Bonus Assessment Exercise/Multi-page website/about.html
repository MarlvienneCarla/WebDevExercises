            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Gossip, Secrets, and Lies
                From the novel's very first page, Karen M. McManus establishes that the world of Bayview<br> High is ruled by a volatile network of gossip, secrets, and lies. The novel's title is deceivingâ€”<br>it's not just one of the protagonists, but all four, who are lying to each other and often to<br> themselves.</p>
